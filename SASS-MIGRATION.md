# Sass Migration: From @import to @use/@forward

## What Was Fixed

Successfully migrated all SCSS files from deprecated `@import` syntax to modern `@use` and `@forward` module system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Module Index (`src/assets/scss/_index.scss`)
```scss
// Modern Sass module system - forwards all partials
@forward 'variables';
@forward 'mixins';
@forward 'wrappers';
```

This index file uses `@forward` to re-export all modules, making them available as a single namespace.

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration

**Before:**
```scss
additionalData: `
  @use "sass:math";
  @import "@/assets/scss/_variables.scss";
  @import "@/assets/scss/_mixins.scss";
  @import "@/assets/scss/_wrappers.scss";
`
```

**After:**
```scss
additionalData: `
  @use "sass:math";
  @use "@/assets/scss" as *;
`
```

The `as *` syntax loads all forwarded members into the global namespace, maintaining backward compatibility.

### 3. Cleaned Up Partial Files

Removed old Vue CLI references from:
- `_variables.scss`
- `_mixins.scss`
- `_wrappers.scss`

## Benefits

âœ… **Zero Deprecation Warnings** - No more `@import` warnings  
âœ… **Future-Proof** - Compatible with Dart Sass 3.0+  
âœ… **Better Performance** - Module system is more efficient  
âœ… **Namespace Control** - Prevents variable/mixin collisions  
âœ… **Explicit Dependencies** - Clear module relationships  

## Module System Explained

### `@use` vs `@import`

| Feature | `@import` (Old) | `@use` (New) |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Namespacing | Global scope | Scoped by default |
| Performance | Slower, duplicates code | Faster, loads once |
| Future | Deprecated, removed in 3.0 | Standard going forward |
| Organization | Messy global variables | Clean, modular |

### `@forward` 

Used to re-export modules from an index file. This allows:
```scss
// Instead of:
@use 'scss/variables';
@use 'scss/mixins';
@use 'scss/wrappers';

// We can now do:
@use 'scss' as *;
```

## How It Works

1. **Vite injects** `@use "@/assets/scss" as *;` into every SCSS file
2. **The index file** (`_index.scss`) forwards all partials
3. **Variables and mixins** are available globally in all components
4. **`sass:math`** module is also available globally

## Usage in Components

All existing code works unchanged:

```scss
<style lang="scss" scoped>
.my-component {
  color: $primary;           // âœ… Works (from _variables.scss)
  @include border(2px);      // âœ… Works (from _mixins.scss)
  
  width: math.div(100%, 3);  // âœ… Works (from sass:math)
}
</style>
```

## Files Modified

- âœ… `vite.config.js` - Updated additionalData
- âœ… `src/assets/scss/_variables.scss` - Cleaned up
- âœ… `src/assets/scss/_mixins.scss` - Cleaned up
- âœ… `src/assets/scss/_wrappers.scss` - Cleaned up
- âœ… `src/assets/scss/_index.scss` - **New file** with @forward

## Verification

Build output shows **zero deprecation warnings**:

```bash
npm run build
# âœ“ 50 modules transformed.
# âœ“ built in 768ms
# (No Sass warnings!)
```
